RuFaas Coding challenge!
=======================================

John has a cattle farm which consists of a few pens. Each pen houses some cows. The cows in each pen are of the same breed. Each breed of cow eats only one type of feed, yields a certain amount of milk, and generates a certain level of greenhouse gases.

 

John has asked you to help him simulate his farm so he can foresee the consequences of his decisions. Develop a code based on OOP to simulate this cattle farm, and run a few scenarios to showcase how it works. Some example features of this simulation are: 

Pen allocation: What breed is allocated to this pen? How many cows are there?
Milk yield calculation: How much milk should we expect from each pen? Can you make a time series?
Greenhouse gas emissions: Overall, how much greenhouse gas does this scenario generate?
Cost estimation: Based on the type and amount of the consumed feeds, how much does it cost John to implement this scenario on his farm?
