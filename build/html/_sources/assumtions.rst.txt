Understanding and Assumptions
===============================

It was understood clearly from the challenge description that a farm will have N pens - A room/barn where cows of same breed are put in.
The objective of the challenge is to find out
1. Estimated milk each pen will produce
2. Cost to maintain each pen/Overall farm
3. Greenhouse gas generated in this scenario

In order to achieve the result, following assumptions and decision were made:
1. Each cow will produce 1 gallon of milk
2. Due to lack of data, we will calculate the milk production for each pen 
    * Number of days * number of cows in the pen
3. Cost estimation = Number of days * number of cows in the pen * cost per cow
